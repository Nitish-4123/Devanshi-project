# AI Copilot prototype
designed to answer queries from structured data in the Email Conversations module stored in MongoDB.

---

# Tech Stack
- Backend: Flask (Python)  
- Database:MongoDB  
- Frontend: HTML, CSS  

# Features
- Dynamic Querying: Filter emails by "date, sender, receiver, subject, or delivery status".  
- Flexible Matching: Automatically recognizes and matches individual words in subjects, senders, and receivers.  
- Intuitive Interface: Built with Flask, offering a simple web interface for querying.

## Future Enhancements
To expand the current prototype into a full-fledged "AI Copilot", the following features can be added:
- Natural Language Processing (NLP): To interpret complex queries and extract meaningful intent.  
- Keyword Expansion with Embeddings: For smarter matching of related terms.  
- Machine Learning Model: To classify and prioritize emails based on importance or sentiment.
